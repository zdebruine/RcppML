The 'RcppML' package provides high-performance machine learning algorithms using Rcpp with a focus on matrix factorization.

## Installation

Install the latest development version of RcppML from github:

```{R, eval = FALSE}
library(devtools)
install_github("zdebruine/RcppML")
```

```{R}
library(RcppML)
library(Matrix)
```

## Non-Negative Least Squares

RcppML contains extremely fast NNLS solvers. Use the `nnls` function to solve systems of equations subject to non-negativity constraints.

The `RcppML::solve` function solves the equation \eqn{ax = b} for \eqn{x} where \eqn{a} is symmetric positive definite matrix of dimensions \eqn{m x m} and \eqn{b} is a vector of length \eqn{m} or a matrix of dimensions \eqn{m x n}.

```{R}
# construct a system of equations
X <- matrix(rnorm(2000),100,20)
btrue <- runif(20)
y <- X %*% btrue + rnorm(100)
a <- crossprod(X)
b <- crossprod(X, y)

# solve the system of equations
x <- RcppML::nnls(a, b)

# use only coordinate descent
x <- RcppML::nnls(a, b, fast_nnls = FALSE, cd_maxit = 1000, cd_tol = 1e-8)
```

`RcppML::solve` implements a new and fastest-in-class algorithm for non-negative least squares:

1. *initialization* is done by solving for the unconstrained least squares solution.
2. *forward active set tuning* (FAST) provides a near-exact solution (often exact for well-conditioned systems) by setting all negative values in the unconstrained solution to zero, re-solving the system for only positive values, and repeating the process until the solution for values not constrained to zero is strictly positive. Set `cd_maxit = 0` to use only the FAST solver.
3. *Coordinate descent* refines the FAST solution and finds the best solution discoverable by gradient descent. The coordinate descent solution is only used if it gives a better error than the FAST solution. Generally, coordinate descent re-introduces variables constrained to zero by FAST back into the feasible set, but does not dramatically change the solution.

## Projecting Linear Models

Project dense linear factor models onto real-valued sparse matrices (or any matrix coercible to `Matrix::dgCMatrix`) using `RcppML::project`. 

`RcppML::project` solves the equation \eqn{A = WH} for \eqn{H}.

```{R}
# simulate a sparse matrix
A <- rsparsematrix(1000, 100, 0.1)

# simulate a linear factor model
w <- matrix(runif(1000 * 10), 1000, 10)

# project the model
h <- RcppML::project(A, w)
```

## Non-negative Matrix Factorization

`RcppML::nmf` finds a non-negative matrix factorization by alternating least squares (alternating projections of linear models \eqn{w} and \eqn{h}).

There are several ways in which the NMF algorithm differs from other currently available methods:

* Diagonalized scaling of factors to sum to 1, permitting convex L1 regularization along the entire solution path
* Fast stopping criteria, based on correlation between models across consecutive iterations
* Extremely fast algorithms using the Eigen C++ library, optimized for matrices that are >90% sparse
* Support for NMF or unconstrained matrix factorization
* Parallelized using OpenMP multithreading

The following example runs rank-10 NMF on a random 1000 x 1000 matrix that is 90% sparse:

```{R}
A <- rsparsematrix(100, 100, 0.1)
model <- RcppML::nmf(A, 10, verbose = F)

w <- model$w
d <- model$d
h <- model$h
model_tolerance <- tail(model$tol, 1)
```

Tolerance is simply a measure of the average correlation between \eqn{w_{i-1} and \eqn{w_i} and \eqn{h_{i-1}} and \eqn{h_i} for a given iteration \eqn{i}.

For symmetric factorizations (when \code{symmetric = TRUE}), tolerance becomes a measure of the correlation between \eqn{w_i} and \eqn{h_i}, and diagonalization is automatically performed to enforce symmetry:

```{R}
A_sym <- as(crossprod(A), "dgCMatrix")

model <- RcppML::nmf(A_sym, 10, verbose = F)
```

Mean squared error of a factorization can be calculated for a given model using the `RcppML::mse` function:

```{R}
RcppML::mse(A_sym, model$w, model$d, model$h)
```
